Python startup project with django framework

This file is to write all the necessary information about when and how the project is changed

To create django project, check if you have installed django with command:
    py -m django --version

If django exists in the system, create project with:
    py -m django startproject project001

The further steps are followed from the website: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/
    "project001" is named by me. The website named it as "mysite"
